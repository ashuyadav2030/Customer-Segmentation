# Customer-Segmentation

In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I will divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.

# Objective

The objective is to identify customer segments that exhibit similar characteristics, allowing for a more targeted and personalized approach to product modification and addressing customer concerns.

# Problems:
The project aims to address several challenges related to customer segmentation in the groceries industry. These challenges include:

- Lack of personalized product modification: Without proper customer segmentation, the business may struggle to modify its products to meet the distinct needs and behaviors of different customer groups. This can result in a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to cater to specific customer preferences.

- Inefficient resource allocation: Without understanding customer segments, the business may allocate resources inefficiently, such as marketing efforts or inventory management. By identifying distinct customer groups, the company can allocate resources more effectively and tailor strategies to each segment's requirements.

- Limited customer satisfaction: Without segmenting customers, the business may struggle to address the concerns and preferences of different types of customers. This can lead to decreased customer satisfaction and loyalty, hindering the company's growth and success.

# Goals:
The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- Customer segmentation: The project aims to cluster customers into meaningful segments based on similarities in their records. This segmentation will enable a deeper understanding of customer groups and their specific characteristics.

- Personalized product modification: By identifying customer segments, the project seeks to optimize product modification according to the distinct needs and behaviors of each segment. This will allow the business to tailor its offerings to meet specific customer preferences, enhancing customer satisfaction.

- Improved resource allocation: Through customer segmentation, the project aims to allocate resources more efficiently. This includes optimizing marketing efforts, inventory management, and other business strategies based on the requirements and behaviors of different customer segments.

- Enhanced customer satisfaction: By addressing the concerns and preferences of different customer groups, the project aims to improve overall customer satisfaction. This will contribute to higher customer loyalty and retention, positively impacting the success of the business.
